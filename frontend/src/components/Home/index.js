            <p>
              The best thing I ever learned is how to build Web Applications. Started as a Software Engineer in 2007, I made a long
              way from Junior Engineer to Lead, Head of UI, Entrepreneur and TPM in a list of different companies from all around
              the world. There were tops, big and small, product and outsource, startups and enterprise, off-shore and on-side. After all
              these years I know a lot about how the business works and learned what people expect when they invest money into a Web Project.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned how to turn a business idea into a Concept, estimate Effort, determine Costs and Risks, create Create Prototype
              or even MVP. I believe that the best technical solutions could be made only by a group of connected people. I can help 
              Staff a successful Team, organize Efficient Development Process and Smooth Delivery.
            </p>

              By nature I'm getting on with people well, but engineering is tough. Master Degree in Software helps me to stay on a same
              page with engineers, when the natural sociability and knowledge of business processes allows me to Connect those worlds in one.
